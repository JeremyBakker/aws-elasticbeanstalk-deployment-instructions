# Deploying Your Capstone with Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon, is the leading provider of on-demand cloud computing 
platforms and APIs. According to 
[Canalys](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-q4-2020), AWS owns 
around one third of the cloud computing market and has reported revenue of $12.7 billion 
for Q4 2020. Your ability to display your capstone on AWS servers will signal to 
employers you ability to work on a modern software development team, many of which are 
now responsible for the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of their software 
stack in the cloud.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
AWS developed Elastic Beanstalk to facilitate the deployment of web applications with 
AWS managed services. It orchestrates the provisioning and monitoring of the 
infrastructure necessary to manage a scalable and secure web application developed 
with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, or Go.

## Getting Started

### AWS Account
Working with AWS Elastic Beanstalk requires an AWS account. Fortunately, as of March 
2021 this remains free. Amazon offers an extended free-tier account that gives free 
access for one year to all the services you will need to deploy your application with 
Elastic Beanstalk. Even still, note that setting up an AWS account requires an active 
credit card, which will be billed if your usage exceeds the free tier limit. These 
instructions will teach you how to set up daily billing alerts as an additional tool 
to prevent unwanted charges.

#### Creating and Activating Your Account
1. Open the [Amazon Web Services home page](https://aws.amazon.com/).

   **Continue**.

happens, you can access your account with the email address and password you used to 
register. 

#### Setting Up an IAM User and Root Multi-factor Authentication

5. Navigate to **IAM** with the search bar at the top of the screen.
6. Choose **Users** on the left navigation menu.
7. Select **Add user**.
8. Enter a **User name** and check both **Programmatic** and **AWS Management 
   Console** access.

   **Require password reset** for the user at initial sign-in.

#### Setting Up a Budget

   username; IAM password, and account number. 
   
   <br style="text-align: center">**Store this information in the securest manner 
   possible. Consider using a password manager such as LastPass or One Password. Your 
   finances are now tied to these credentials. In the wrong hands, an AWS account can 
   accrue charges rapidly, even with a daily budget.**</br>     
   

5. **Sign out** of the Root account through the account dropdown menu in the top right 
   corner of the screen.

<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;"> A Note on the Root User </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It is widely considered bad practice to perform 
tasks with the root user. The root user should only be used to create the first IAM 
user, to open billing privileges to administrators, and to close the account. Store 
the credentials securely.</p>
